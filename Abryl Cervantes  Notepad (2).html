<div>In my area in Reseda California, recently so much crime has been happening. There has been cars getting into. People are robbing houses. My neighbor car was broken into 2 weeks ago and they sold everything insde like money, they even stold a part of the car. She said " These people all they know is to rob". There has been times were in my area people have taken pictures when your sleeping.&nbsp; Your doors have to be locked all times or people can get inside your house. Going to the stores is sometimes scary for people where I live because there is a lot of crime, either getting off to your car, you could be robbed. Especailly walking alone is more dangerous because they see the perfect opportunity.&nbsp; Not even just robbing there has been stabbing and shooting and assult in this area as well. On July 25 the LAPD shoot and killed a suspect outside of a dennys at Reseda.</div>
